# Final-Discord-Bot
Graduation Project

gives information about video games (add at least 20 games and their informations if asked)
add a second bot that corrects the first bot's informations (use time and random)


also, it gives the project link you ask for, like if you ask for the meme generator project, it gives the github and the actual game link(ask to the teacher if its possible)
