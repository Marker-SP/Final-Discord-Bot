# Final-Discord-Bot

Graduation Project
by Cem...

A discord bot named "Bilge"
I did this project because i couldnt find the correct meaning of some slangs and memes i didnt get, 
so i can ask to this bot now

This discord bot:
- gives you a list about commands you can use,
- gives information about the game you choose,
- gives you the explanation of the meme you didnt get,
- tells you the meaning of the gen z slangs
- has basic math and fun codes

After running the bot from python, its not a AI bot so you cant ask anything, 
you can just ask the questions on the help list...

Feel free to give feedbacks, you can ask me questions about the bot from discord.

This project is important because it may become a meme/slang dictionary in the future... Who knows?
